# Crossbones and Treasure chests

Hey, this is a simple tic tac toe game with a little razzle dazzle of style and music. Still a WIP to put images to the board instead of the text O and X.

## Introduction

For anyone who doesn't know tic tac toe, you and another player choose who is X or O or in this game "CrossBones" or "Treasure Chest" and you place them on the board of 9 squares or boxes. First one to get 3 in a row win or draw if no one gets 3 in a row. The music being played is my own mix from the groovepad app on mobile phone [Game Motivation] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe  and 
[Live Site]

## Game Play

One player is X (Crossbones) and the other is O (treasure chests) you pick where you want to place your crossbones or chests until one player wins or there is a draw by filling all the squares with no one getting 3 in a row.

## Rules:

rules are self-explanantory since this is a simple 3 in a row game. Try to get 3 in a row in any way (diagonal, horizontal, or vertical) without the other player blocking you.
